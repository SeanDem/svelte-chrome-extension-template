## Installing Dependencies

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm i

```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`)
```bash
npm run dev

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
